## Indicators:

### Momentum Indicators:

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures
the speed and magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate whether
a stock or asset is overbought or oversold.

Ranges from 0 to 100, typically 70 and 30 as the overbought and oversold levels.
